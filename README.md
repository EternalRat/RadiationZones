# RadiationZones

This plugin has been made to learn how Minecraft works.
It was my first plugin and it's still not finish yet.
I'm of course planning to finish it when I'll have some free time or just when I'll know what I wanna add to it.

##Main goal

The final goal of this plugin will be to create a toxic environment where being under the rain will make you die.

Food, animals will also be poisoned and you'll die if you try to hit or to eat one.

Of course, there'll be some antidotes and special armor specially made for you to be able to go outside & to clean food before eating it.


Thx
